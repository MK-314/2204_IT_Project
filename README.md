## Overview 

Our project team developed and conducted a survey among our classmates and the families of each participant to reach the conclusion of which app would best suit the Canadian market and what services our local community needs that could be satisfied by features of our application. 

We concluded that a Recipe App would be the perfect choice to practice Native React coding and meet the expectations of our code expert and teacher - Mr. Xing Liu and potential customers.

For our project we chose to code a mobile recipes app for users to be able to view, create and share their favorites with other users. Our application will allow users to create a library of all of their recipes in the convenience of their phones.
